## Research Project
### Summer intern at start-up organistion
I was a summer intern at the start-up organistion MmM under Mahesh Parihar, founder of MmM Ltd and Project Manager of SEIL lab at IIT Bombay. 
I could develop a Machine learning model for Heart attack prediction. Further, I could learn python and its Machine Learning libraries in an elaborated way.
#### Development of model
* The model implemented was a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithm which consisted of Fuzzy Clustering algorithm followed by Support Vector Machine.
* The model is implemented on Cleveland dataset from UCI Machine learning repository.
* Preprocessing of data, Exploratory data analysis, and different testing and validation methods was performed to increase the accuracy the model.
* Anomaly detection is also be implemented on the dataset.

## Academic Projects
* Pedestrian Detection and Direction Prediction using Video Processing
  * The system is implemented using three different methods of pedestrian detection and path prediction using input videos for prediction.
* Digit Recognition system using Machine learning
  * Hand-written digits are recognised using multi-class classification using Neural Network from a sample of images of hand written digits.
* Counting the number of coins in an image using Image Processing
  * Different image processing techniques were used to perform region segmentation and hence identify the coins and calculate their size from an image of coins.
* Banking system
  * Banking system is implemented using object oriented programming and file handling to create, delete, update account of holder.
* Maze turtle implementation
  * Implementing a maze problem for a turtle to find its way out of a user defined maze.
  * Basic back-tracking algorithm was used along with a 2-D array to make a maze.
* Rotation of solar panels for maximum utilization of sunlight[[ppt]]() [[code]](https://github.com/Tuniya-Neha/Solar_panels)
  * Solar Panels are usually fixed at an angle and can convert sunlight into useful electrical energy only for a few hours of the day.
  * Implementing a system with a sensor, a microcontroller and an actuator, the direction of the sunlight is observed, and the solar panels are rotated accordingly for maximum utilization of available sunlight
